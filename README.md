# About Othello

### Othello is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8×8 uncheckered board. Two players compete, using 64 identical game pieces ("disks") that are white on one side and black on the other. Each player chooses one color to use throughout the game. Players take turns placing one disk on an empty square, with their assigned color facing up. After a play is made, any disks of the opponent's color that lie in a straight line bounded by the one just played and another one in the current player's color are turned over. When all playable empty squares are filled, the player with more disks showing in their own color wins the game.

# Game Setup

### ● Initially, the board is set up by placing two black disks and
two white disks at the center of the board exactly as shown
in the opposite figure. The game always begins with this
setup.
### ● Then, the remaining 60 disks are divided between players
such that each player has 30 disks.

# How the game goes

### 1. When it’s a player’s turn, he must look for an empty square on the board that is adjacent to one of the opponent’s pieces. The player can add his disk there with his color facing upwards.
### 2. If the newly added disk encloses a straight horizontal row or vertical column of the opponent’s pieces between two disks of the player’s color, then it’s a legal move known as “outflanking”.

### 3. Once the player outflanks the opponent's disks, they are flipped over to the player’s color (i.e. the player captured them). The disks now count as the player’s pieces on the board even if he didn’t originally play them.
### 4. After that the player passes the turn to his opponent to continue playing.
### 5. When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over. Disks are counted and the player with the majority of their color showing is the winner.

# Game Rules

### ● Black always moves first.
### ● If a player cannot outflank and flip at least one opposing disk, they miss their turn and their opponent moves again.
### ● A disk may outflank any number of disks in one or more rows in any direction (either horizontally or vertically) at the same time.

### ● Players may not skip over their own color disks to outflank an opposing disk.

### ● Disks may only be outflanked as a direct result of a move and must fall in the direct line of the disk placed down.
